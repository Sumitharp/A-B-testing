    " A company wants to increase traffic (i.e conversion rate) on it website by changing the newsletter. We divide the newsletter into 2 parts A and B where A will remain unchanged and B's newsletter has significant changes.<p>\n",
    "On basis of performance of the two groups we decide which is performing better. *Population refers to entire traffic on the website, and sample is the number of customers that participated on the test*\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Make Hypothesis: Educted guess -- insight into natural world. This is testable by experiment or observation. In this example : By changing newsletter we will get more traffic on to our website\n",
    "    a) **Null Hypothesis** -- H0 -- States that sample observations are purely by chance. There is no difference in the results from A(Control group) and B(test group)\n",
    "\n",
    "    b) **Alternative Hypothesis** -- Ha -- This challenges the null hypothesis.. and that which we believe to be true. In this case, the changes in newsletter will bring more traffic to the website.\n",
